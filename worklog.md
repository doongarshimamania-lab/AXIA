Task: Fix light mode across all pages - comprehensive light/dark theme support

Work Log:
- Analyzed uploaded screenshot showing light mode issues (dark sidebar, inconsistent white spacing)
- Used VLM to analyze screenshot - confirmed: dark sidebar vs light content, unequal white spacing, low contrast text
- Audited entire codebase - found 200+ hardcoded dark colors across 17+ components without `dark:` prefix
- Fixed globals.css with comprehensive light mode overrides:
  - Added `:root:not(.dark)` selector with light gradient token overrides
  - Added `[data-theme="light"]` fallback alias with same overrides
  - Added global CSS overrides for bg-slate-950/900/800 → light surfaces in light mode
  - Added text-white override to dark text in light mode (except on accent backgrounds)
  - Added border-white/5, border-slate-700/800 fixes for light mode
  - Added text-slate-200/300/400/500/600 contrast fixes for light mode
  - Added bg-white/5/10/20 fixes for light mode
  - Added hover state fixes for light mode
  - Added gradient-from/via/to fixes for light mode
  - Added Dialog/Tooltip content overrides for light mode
  - Added gradient utility class light mode overrides
  - Added accent-tint light mode variants
  - Added bg-safe-dark light mode override
- Fixed CollapsibleSidebar.tsx: font-[Space_Grotesk] → font-sans, NavItem text colors for light mode, scrollbar light mode
- Fixed DashboardExpertNew.tsx: 30+ class transformations
- Fixed ProtectionScoreCardPro.tsx: 21 class transformations
- Fixed ProtectionScoreCardExpert.tsx: 27+ class transformations
- Fixed MilestoneProtectionExpert.tsx: 60+ class transformations
- Fixed 22 additional components via parallel subagent (DashboardProNew, DashboardStarterNew, DashboardFreeNew, DashboardExpert, VulnerabilityScanner, ProjectRiskTimelinePro/Expert/Free/Starter, TimelineVisualization, ValueMetricCard, UpgradePrompt, EvidenceGapPrediction, EvidenceHealthScore, EvidenceItemsList, WorkContentAnalysis, TeamValidation, DisputeSuccessSimulation, ProtectionMetrics, ProtectionScoreCard, ClientGapPrediction, OwnerDashboard, WaitlistSuccessModal)
- Synced index.css with globals.css
- Built and deployed successfully
- Verified both light and dark mode visually using VLM analysis of screenshots

Stage Summary:
- Light mode now works properly across all pages
- All 200+ hardcoded dark colors converted to `dark:` prefix pattern
- Gradient utility classes auto-adapt to light/dark mode
- Sidebar properly switches between light/dark
- Teal brand color looks good in both modes
- Build passes, preview server running on port 3000
